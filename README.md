# Python-Final-Assignment
A to-do list program that will allow the user to manage a total of four to-do lists as follows:
1. Weekly to-do list
2. Monthly to-do list
3. Yearly goals list
4. Summer programming study task list.

The lists are stored in separate text files. When the program runs, the user should be able to continuously select different lists 
and modify them until they enter ‘q’ or ‘Q’ to quit. 

While the program is running, users should be able to choose to do the following:
1.  select a list
2. print a list
3. add to a list (if an item is already present, it is not added)
4. remove from the list
5. save a list. 

They should be able to continuously modify a list until they save the list. Once they’ve saved the list, 
the program should go back to the main menu and give the user the option to select a list.
